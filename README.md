# Computer Vision

## 1. OpenCV
* OpenCV is a open source programming library with real-time computer vision capabilities

### 1.1 Modules of opencv
* core - used for basic core functions, data structure, functionality to other modules.
* ImgProc - used for image processing-color spaces, geometrical transformation, histogram, image filtering.
* dnn - used for functionality for loading serialized network models.
* ML - userd for regression task, clusturing task in image , anomaly detection.
* video - used for video analysis including background substraction, motion estimation, and object tracking algorithms.
* highgui - create and manipulate windows that can display images.
* flann - fast library for approximate nearest neighbors-collection of algorithms that are highly suited for fast nearest neighbors search.
* photo - provides the functions of the computational photograpghy.
* stiching - implements a stiching pipeline that performs automatic panoromic image stiching.
* shape - shape distance and matching, can be used for shape matching, retrival or comparison.
* superres - this modeule contains a set of classes and methods that can be used for resolution enhancement.
* videostab - used for video stabilization.
* viz - 3D visualizer display widgets that provides several methods to interact with sence and widgets.
* imgcodecs - used for image codecs, image file read & write.
* objdetect - detection of objects and instances of predifined classes.
* features2d - used for 2D features framework. This modeule includes feature detector, descriptors and descriptor matches.
* calib3d - used for camera calibration 3D reconstruction, covers basic multiple view geometry algorithms, stereo corespondence algorithms, object pose estimation, both single and stereo camera calibration, and also 3D reconstruction.

### 1.2 Application of computer vision
* Feature matching
* 3D image stiching
* Egomotion Estimation
* Medical Image Analysis
* Human computer interface
* stereo vision
* segmentation & recognition
* structure from motion
* Augmented reality
* motion tracking

## Basic of Imge
#### what is an image?
* An image can be described as a 2D function, f(x,y) where (x,y) are the spetial coordinates and the value of f at any point (x,y) is proportional to the brightness or gray levels of the image.

#### Difference between image and digital image?
* The value of f(x,y) will be always a descrite value in digital image.

#### Grayscale image
* No color information. The pixel only contain the gray levels.
* single channel

#### RGB image
* color information is mandatory, the pixel to contain the RGB element.
* Three channel

## Color Spaces
* A color space is mathematical model describing the way color can be represented using tuples of numbers.

#### Major cknown color spaces
* RGB
* CMYK
* HSV
* LAB 

## 3. Basic image function
#### image reading
    img = cv2.imread('image.png', cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    img1 = cv2.imread('image.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    img = cv2.imread('image.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)

#### display function
    cv2.imshow('show image', img1)
